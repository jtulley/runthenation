<p>St. Jude is a world leader in developing new, improved treatments for children with cancer, and we create more clinical trials for cancer than any other children’s hospital. We freely share those breakthroughs, and every child saved at St. Jude means doctors and scientists worldwide can use that knowledge to save thousands more children. Still today as we opened our doors, families never receive a bill from St. Jude for treatment, travel, housing, or food — because all they should worry about is helping their child live. Danny Thomas passed away in 1991, but he left St. Jude with an enduring legacy and commitment to saving the lives of children everywhere. St. Jude won’t stop until no child dies from cancer.</p>
