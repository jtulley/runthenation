<p><span style="color: red">“RUN THE NATION”</span><span style="color: blue"> Please Help Fund This Worthy Cause With Lisa !!</span> </p>

<p>Lisa Smith-Batchen has used her gift of running incredibly long distances to raise millions of dollars for various organizations throughout the world.  The Dreamchaser Foundation, Inc. is a <strong>501(c) 3 non-profit organization</strong> established by Lisa to support her humanitarian efforts on a global scale.  Please help her continue to make a difference in the world by donating.  Every donation matters and no amount is too small as she works to change the world one step at a time. Your financial contribution to the Dreamchaser Foundation supports fundraising efforts by covering the operational costs for <strong>RUN The Nation project</strong> and its entire support crew. </p>

<p>This undertaking requires support vehicles, fuel, lodging, insurance and communication and GPS tracking equipment, among other things. Lisa and the support crew consume a ridiculous amount of calories daily.  Hydration, athletic gear and medical supplies for 12 are required to cover the 3,100 miles; the logistics for RUN The Nation are mind boggling.</p>   

<p>We appreciate your generosity and again, every donation makes a difference. </p>
<p>From the bottom of our hearts we thank you…<strong>Lisa & Team RUN The Nation</strong></p>

<p>Donations to the project are tax deductible. (If you’d prefer to donate directly to St. Jude’s, please <a href="https://shop.stjude.org/GiftCatalog/donation.do?cID=14262&pID=24671&sc_icid=header-btn-donate-now" _target="new">Click Here</a>.)</p>

St. Jude is a world leader in developing new, improved treatments for children with cancer, and we create more clinical trials for cancer than any other children’s hospital. We freely share those breakthroughs, and every child saved at St. Jude means doctors and scientists worldwide can use that knowledge to save thousands more children. Still today as we opened our doors, families never receive a bill from St. Jude for treatment, travel, housing, or food — because all they should worry about is helping their child live. Danny Thomas passed away in 1991, but he left St. Jude with an enduring legacy and commitment to saving the lives of children everywhere. St. Jude won’t stop until no child dies from cancer.
