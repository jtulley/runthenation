Crew Bios:
John Wallace III:  
Documentation, Logistics
The dot matrix printer slowly spit out a sign with big bold letters: "Running is NOT my life".  A couple years later I headed out for a 4 mile run on New Year's Eve 1989.  Twenty-six adventurous years later that sign could not be further from the truth.  Tens of thousands of miles, hundreds of races and new friends, and scores of shoes retired, running touches just about every aspect of my life today.  After running 3800 miles across the USA ten years ago, I began to archive and promote every transcontinental crossing on foot.  From just under a dozen listed to over 300 chronicled today, every crossing is unique in route, method, and cause.  Extremely excited to offer my expertise in logistics, history, and documentation to Lisa as we Run the Nation.

Patrick Hains
Transportation
Patrick has as much in common with an endurance athlete as he does a 60 year old blues slide guitar player.  But he can set up and tear down event periphery, get Lisa to the starting points along the way, hopefully anticipate her needs, fix equipment, collect Lisa at the finish, make sure gear and people are not left behind, pack everything back up efficiently, make sure everyone is safely on their way to the next day, and then get up and do it again.

Vincent Antunez
Medical
Vincent is the founder and owner of Trail Toes Phenomenal Ultra Extreme Anti Friction Foot and Body Cream, LLC.  In addition to running a small business, he is also a full time assistant professor and the assistant program director at the University of Memphis Health Science Center physician assistant program.  Vincent has been running since he was first introduced to Volks Marches in Germany in 2001.  Since that time, he has completed over 2500 kilometers running across Europe.

Laura Buitron
EMT and Pacer
Running started 3 years ago when I decided it was time to reinvent myself and go back to live in-land.  Lisa Smith-Batchen is helping me with this big transition in my life.  Not only she coaches me to challenge my body to run races from half marathons to 50 miles, but also she guides me to endure and overcome the challenges in my personal life.  My personal and professional life are all one.  My personality has been impregnated with a mix of cultures and I have acquired many skills through the different working environments I have been exposed to.  This gave me the ability to be a "Wild Card" in helping, supporting, and finding the way to get things done.  And I will put all my heart into helping Lisa to accomplish her new project, as I believe her life philosophy, "Alone we can do so little, together we can do so much".

Krasse Gueorguiev
Logistics, Support Staff
I have lived in London for the last 19 years where I started running.  Initially it was to just lose weight, but then I got addicted, and after 60 marathons, decided to do something bigger.That is how I transitioned into stage races and longer one-day races.  After completing MDS, my running took a downhill spiral but thanks to Lisa, I managed to start enjoying it again.  Since then we have done together three 100 milers, a 140 mile race, as well as a 100K race.  My plans are to be running at Badwater next year.  The ultimate dream is to cross Antarctica unsupported, and yes my dreams scare me, but that is what it is about.
